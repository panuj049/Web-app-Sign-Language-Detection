Sign Language to Text Translator
Children with disabilities often face significant barriers in accessing effective cognitive retraining programs, limiting their ability to develop crucial cognitive skills. One major challenge is the lack of accessible communication tools that bridge the gap between sign language users and written language.

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop an initial prototype of a Sign Language to Text Translator, a tool that can recognize sign language gestures and convert them into written text in real-time. The goal is to enhance communication accessibility, particularly for children with hearing or speech impairments, enabling them to engage more effectively in educational and social settings.

🚀 Key Features
Sign Language Recognition: Uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand gestures.

Text Translation: Converts recognized gestures into corresponding written text.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed for easy interaction, particularly for children.

Scalability: Can be extended to support multiple sign languages in future versions.

🔧 Technology Stack
Python (OpenCV, Mediapipe, TensorFlow/Keras)

Machine Learning Models (for gesture recognition)

Flask/FastAPI (for backend services)

React/HTML-CSS-JS (for frontend UI)

🎯 Future Scope
Expand support for different sign languages.

Implement real-time audio output for better accessibility.

Develop a mobile-friendly version for wider usability.

🤝 Contributions & Feedback
This project is in its early stages, and contributions are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving the model, enhancing the UI, or optimizing performance, feel free to contribute or share feedback.

📌 Let's work together to make communication more inclusive! 💙
